			-- Making Decisions is Hard : Leave That to Us! --
		</div>

		<div class="content-wrapper">
			Your life probably isn't going the way you planned. Planned. Who are we kidding? You didn't plan.
			<br>
			<br>
			You just hoped.
			<br>
			<br>
			Clearly, the root of all your suffering is the poor decisions you have made and good decisions that you didn't make.
			<br>
			<br>
			But hey! We don't blame you. Choice is a terrible burden. Today there is reason for you to have hope for a brighter future, because you have found Us. It's time for you to relenquish all of your decision making authority to Us, and finally make steps toward the future you never planned for.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			It's time for you to Lose Control.
